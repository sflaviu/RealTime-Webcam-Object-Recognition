# RealTime-Webcam-Object-Recognition
Small personal project- detect movement on camera, extract image of moving object, run it through a trained classifier (different types of features and algorithms tried - Logistic Regression and KNN) and display what object is moving in real time . I have constructed a small dataset with a few of my own objects on a white background to train the classifiers.Technologies used: Scikit-learn and OpenCV
